title: Depressed
---
I think you ought to know that I’m feeling very depressed. I’ve felt this coming on for a week or two. I thought that I was fed up or bored with work. But today I was looking at what I have to do and it’s not so boring. There’s enough to do and it’s fairly interesting problems that I’m expected to solve.

So – what could it be? Home life? I love coming home. Baby, wife, home – it’s all very nice. I haven’t read the scriptures in a few weeks. It could be that. I’ll give it a try. Tonight and tomorrow morning.
