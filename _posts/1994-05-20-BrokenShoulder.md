title: I Broke My Shoulder
---

In March 1994 I had a job. I worked at the mall selling pagers. This means that now I had a few bucks to throw around. One of the things I decided to splurge on was a pair of Rollerblades.

I believe the model was &#8220;Macroblade Equipe&#8221; - Not sure what that name indicates as far as market segment or intended purpose. But they were the coolest looking Rollerblades around. They were a dark teal green. Not quite &#8220;forest&#8221;, but close. And they had some salmon orange buckles. What a combo!

Some time, probably in late May of that year, I broke my shoulder coming down a big hill on those blades. Here is the card that my friend made me:
