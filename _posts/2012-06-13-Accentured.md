title: Accentured!
---
Many times a colleague will have a good idea – a good solution to a problem. As soon as they try to implement the idea, they run into road blocks:

- We need a signed work-order from the customer.
- We need a charge code for you to bill your time to.
- We need sign-off from an architect.
- We need a change request to deploy that.
- That will require new processes.
- How are we charging for that?
- We have to analyze the requirements before we can go forward.
- Who’s paying for this?
- How are you tracking your time?
- It goes on…

Whenever something like that happens, I like to slam my imaginary rubber stamp onto the table and shout, “Accentured!”
