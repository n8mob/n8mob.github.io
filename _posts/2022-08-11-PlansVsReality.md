# Plans fail in multiple ways


1. Just, simply failing to follow the plan
2. Something going wrong with the plan (unforeseen issues)
3. Tutorials

## Let's create a new app!

> First we make a design that we know will work because we're experienced enough to create a tutorial!
    
> Then we implement that design without any problems because we knew what we were doing when we planned it!

## That was easy! Let's make another one!

> I'm going to make a design of what I want!
    
> Oh, turns out that what I want is (at best) difficult to implement. (And at worst it is incompatible due to some technicality.)
