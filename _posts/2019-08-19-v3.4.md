v3.4
====

Okay - thanks for all your help!

Once again: unless there are show-stoppers, this build will go to production. (Famous last words...)

# Fixed since v3.3
1. Scrolling outside the MAGiE screen is now hidden on tall phones.
2. I think we fixed the undetected wins - but I'll need your help to make sure.
3. Auto-scroll works on deleting (and works on typing much better)
4. Some puzzles were showing 4 bits instead of 5

# Still Unfixed
1. Flaky ads
2. Too-long decoding (`BITZ` vs `BITS`)
