title: Where do We Put the Screen?
---

I don’t know how old I was – but I was no more than six – probably closer to four. My parents came home and told me that they had rented a movie. They had a big, blue, padded case with them. I imagine that I said something like, “Coool!”

“Let’s set it up and watch it!” was my dad’s reply.

“Okay! Where should we put the screen?” I inquired.

“It doesn’t go on the screen.”

I returned a quizzical look.

“It hooks up to the TV.”

My brain exploded a little. I must have been thinking, "you can hook things up to the TV?"
