After Mrs. Briggs's class was Mr. Scrawll's class.

He's our math teacher. He wants us to understand that MAGiE is really a little computer.

I already understand how to use my MAGiE. It's easy. So I'm not paying much attention.

...computers are all binary, and that means ones and zeros. blah, blah, blah...

...transistors are like switches. blah, blah, blah...

...magnets have north and south poles. blah, blah, blah...

...switches and magnets... blah, blah, blah...

...cards have magnetic stripes... blah, blah, blah...

...messages encoded on cards... blah, blah, blah...

...sometimes there are errors... blah, blah, blah...

...error correcting electronics... blah, blah, blah...

...purple bits are wrong... blah, blah, blah...

...switch them to green... blah, blah, blah...

...it's kind of fun... blah, blah, blah...
