title: Whither PC?
---
So – the iPad has been announced. It will be available soon. The apps that come with it plus the iWork apps are almost enough to justify the purchase. Two or three years from now there will be thousands of apps available – apps that do just about everything. So my question is, why would anyone still want a full-blown PC?

### Let me just list a few reasons

1.	Compile and run. In the future there may be an app that can build new apps – but that’s pretty far away.

2.	Content creation in general. Most of the apps demonstrated today at the iPad’s unveiling were content consumers. That doesn’t mean that an app can’t create content – but so far they don’t. Of course there are the iWork applications…
