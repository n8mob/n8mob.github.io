title: Wanna Be Starting Something
---

I've spent the last several months working full time on my game. (MAGiE - join the beta now with TestFlight [on the App Store](https://testflight.apple.com/join/obsIYcRN) and [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.corporealabstract.magie).) I've been working on it in my spare time for years.

Now that I've got a working game, and launch day is in sight: I'm contemplating getting a paying job. The prospect of having a day job and _maintaining_ the game in my spare time seems much more realistic than having a day job and _starting_ the game.

Just an interesting thought that I wanted to share. Thanks for listening.
