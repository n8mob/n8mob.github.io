Walking in.

What's that? Oh, _fancy Unidealistic._

#### Computers
Leather computers? Don't wantos.

Cool-looking stuff &mdash; I don't even know what it's for! Coolos

#### Calculators
If I ever need a calculator I'll know where to buyos.

#### Bugler Alarms
For my room!

Cool if you're a trucker, I guess.

Boros. Oo, look! Speed dial! Dialos!

#### Satellite

#### Keyboards

#### Microphones
That could be fun.

#### Soldering Iron
Now _that's_ the kind of thing we come here for!

Why do you want a soldering iron?

I don't know. To meltos! And, if you're going to invent electronics, you need a soldering iron.

Seems like you should learn what you're doing first.

Look! a _de_-soldering iron! We could take stuff apart and figure out how it workos.

Suit yourself. I want to go to arcade to spendos!

### Wait. What's this?

Huh?

It looks like our MAGiEs, but, _weird._

To the store clerk: Excuse me, what's this?

Clerk: Oh - that's an Interactive Magnetic Data Explorer. It _is_ just like your MAGiE, but more professional.

More professional?

Sure. It can do everything your MAGiE can do and then some. Like, with this add-on, it's compatible with the tape drive for our **TSH-80** color computer.

_Void Infectors:_ can it playos?

No, it's not a computer. It just displays computer data that's on a mag-stripe. It's really a diagnostic tool. But I think they're fun for exploros.

It'd bee cool if it could playos. _Void Infectors_
