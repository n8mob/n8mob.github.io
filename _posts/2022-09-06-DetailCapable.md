Lots of times I read job descriptions and they say that the ideal candidate will be &ldquo;detail-oriented&rdquo;. That's not me.

To be &ldquo;oriented&rdquo; means be aligned with, or tailored for a thing.

I would not say that I am aligned with details or tailored for them. I thought that perhaps I should put something about this on my [résumé](/resume.html).

When I looked up antonyms for &ldquo;detail oriented&rdquo; I saw things like &ldquo;absent minded&rdquo;, &ldquo;inattentive&rdquo;, and &ldquo;scattered&rdquo;.

I wouldn't say that I've _never_ been described in those ways.
But then I saw:

## &ldquo;Thoughtless&rdquo;

&ldquo;Thoughtless&rdquo;? _I_ am the _opposite_ of that. I ignore details so that I can think more clearly.
