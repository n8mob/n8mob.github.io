So cool! TCP: *Tripple* Cassette Player!! Two in front and one in the top. **And the top one came out like a Walkman!!!!!!!!!** And just look at that equalizer! So many bands! Actually, they were hard-linked into imaginary stereo pairs. The volume was actually separate left and right controls.

I don't know how many [Dr. Demento Shows](http://drdemento.com/) got recorded on that thing. But it was a lot! The show [started at 10pm on Sunday night](https://youtu.be/REpfGo4-jGA?t=6). So I'd listen and pause for commercials until the first side of the tape was full. Then I'd flip the tape over. (Auto-reverse? we're not there yet, Sport.) After the tape got flipped I'd pause a couple more commercials and then allow myself to fall asleep. I didn't have auto-reverse, but I did have auto-stop; it was 1987, after all.

Most (but not all) of the time it would catch the [end of the show](https://youtu.be/TM9xldatBUo?t=80).

Before too long I acquired a C120 two-hour cassette that could catch the whole show even if I didn't pause for commercials. Unfortunately, I only had one C120, so I couldn't archive the shows. I just recorded each show over the last one and then listened to it in pieces all week long. Usually I'd finish on Saturdays while I mowed the lawn.
