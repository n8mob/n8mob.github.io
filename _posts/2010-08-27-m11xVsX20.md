title: Alienware M11x vs ThinkPad X20
---

The ThinkPad is close to 10 years old. It has a few advantages over the Alienware. One of them is soft-touch material. I think the material on the inside of the ThinkPad is a nice touch. I like the slightly sparkley finish on the outside – but I think I like the feel of the material on the outside of the Alienware better. However, that might be due to the age of the ThinkPad.

Now for the biggy: the keyboard. I think it’s a toss-up. Each has strengths and each has weaknesses. The backspace key on the ThinkPad is much smaller than on the Alienware. For you this might not be a problem, but I need the backspace key. A lot. Now, the other keys on the Alienware all feel just a little bit smaller. Let’s call the action a toss-up. I think the ThinkPad has more travel up-and-down, but the noise is worse. The Alienware’s keys’ travel is shorter, but the clicky noise is a little more subdued. And the arrow keys on the Alienware are simply atrocious. The only way they could be worse is if they were in the old ←, →, ↑, ↓, configuration of my Mac Plus.

I think that if the Alienware had a track-point I would really be in love with it.
