Yesterday was Sunday. It was my second time teaching Sunday school (Job). Libby and I both spoke in Sacrament meeting. My mom came to hear us speak and to help wrangle Dottie.

At work I have a dream project, but some major design decisions have held me hostage for the last couple days. So, Iâ€™ve been spending much too much time shopping for lawn mowers online.

How many different ways can I find to procrastinate? I can think of a lot, but Internet shopping is a huge time-waster.
