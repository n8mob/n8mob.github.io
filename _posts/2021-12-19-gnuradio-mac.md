Today I learned that homebrew installs the GnuRadio Companion along with the gnuradio package.

But instead of calling it `grc`, it is called `gnuradio-companion`.

So, we should add that to the tutorials:

> After `brew install gnuradio` you just have to run `gnuradio-companion` from a terminal.

Thank you.
