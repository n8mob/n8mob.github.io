v3.5
==============================

1. Fixed some weird Unity bugs
------------------------------
(I'm sure they're not weird if you are an experienced Unity developer.)

2. New Puzzles!
------------------------------
The newest ones are in the "Experiments" category (see below).

3. Categories!
------------------------------
Now we have sub-menus!
Levels are divided by topic:

## Story
Fewer Bits, more words

## Tutorial
Teaching how to play the game, or other concepts.

## (other) Puzzles
Didn't really fit in another category

## Experimental
Puzzles that aren't quite fully baked.
Current experiments include some tutorials about Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal numbers. Later they will move to the tutorial section (or we'll make a new section.)
