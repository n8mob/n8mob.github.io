title: You're Fired! A Memory
---
Long ago, I started my first job as a sixteen-year-old. I was selling pagers at the mall. A family friend was the general manager of the local office of the paging arm of a [Regional Bell Operating Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Company) doing business as "PacTel Paging, A Pacific Telesis Company". I was working my very first shift at the mall when the phone rang.

"Hello?" I answered.

"You're fired," my friend (and my manager's manager) said.

I blinked.

"Now answer the phone correctly and I'll hire you back."

Oh!

_"PacTel Paging: for families on the go! My name is Nate, how may I help you?"_

"Okay, you're hired."
