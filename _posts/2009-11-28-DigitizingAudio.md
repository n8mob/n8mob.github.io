title: Digitizing Audio

## Background

I’ve been craving a digital audio recorder for the last few weeks. When I was a missionary I purchased a microcassette recorder. I’m trying to remember if I had one a few years before that. I must have – at some point.

Anyway, I purchased the recorder and made three tapes. I think the first one was the 30-minute microcassette that came with the device. I filled a 90-minute tape and three quarters of another 90-minute tape with little narrations of what was going on. To aid in memorizing the discussion pamphlets I recorded a couple of them on another tape.

Listening to the tapes, I was pretty pleased. I recorded notes for most of the second half of my mission – at least every now and then.

When the gadget lust hit me for a digital audio recorder, I figured I’d better dig out that cassette recorder. At the very least I wanted to digitize the audio already on there for my mythical mission blog.

There were as many blank tapes in there as there were used ones – so I loaded up a blank one and started recording new things a few days ago.

My dad called me today looking for “Performance Audio” – a local dealer of pro-audio gear. Performance Audio is just the sort of place that I shouldn’t go while this digital-audio gadget lust is so strong. He was looking to get his twenty-year-old compact disc changer repaired. We wondered if this would be a good opportunity to rip all of my parent’s CDs to MP3s.

I had been trying to decide how to record all of my old cassette tapes to a digital format as well. I thought that his nice tape deck would be a good way to do that. And, as long as we had that going, we could digitize all of his old LPs as well.

He thought my idea of ripping to a compact audio recorder was “interesting”. “Interesting” like video-taping a screen is interesting. He chalked it up to generational differences – which it may be. He said he came from a time when bigger was better – which brings me to my real point.

 In digital – it hardly matters how big something is. In fact smaller is usually always better. However, in the analogue world – size matters. There are two main reasons: signal degradation – aka “loss” – and resonance.
 
## Requirements
1.	Digitize cassette tapes

2.	Digitize “vinyl” – LP records

3.	Rip CDs

4.	Acceptable audio characteristics include
	a.	CD bitrates or better
	b.	Full 20 – 20,000 Hz audio range
	c.	Low “noise floor” throughout the capturing system.

5.	Work with Mac OS X 10.whatever on a G4 PowerMac and Windows 7 on a Core 2 Duo Toshiba laptop.

## Approaches

1.  Use existing line-in and Audacity recording software

	**Cost** | Free
	**Pros** | Low cost, immediate start
	**Cons** | Low quality of “built-in” components.

2.	Use external USB audio interface and Audacity or whatever comes with the interface

	**Cost** | USB audio interface, $100 - $200
	**Pros** | Good quality of low-cost audio interface
	**Cons** | audio interface is limited in use to this application

3.	Use a standalone digital recorder (Olympus ls-10/11 or Marantz PMD-661) 

	**Cost** | $300 - $600
	**Pros** | Self-contained, computer not required for actual recording; use of external recorder after this project.
	**Cons** | cost, reservation about quality of recorder hardware
