While I wait for [Apple to review](https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/28/app-review-behind-the-scenes-at-apple/) [MAGiE](https://magiegame.com/magie/), I'm working on a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app.

The app will allow editing of MAGiE puzzles and then export to a format that the MAGiE game can read.

After that, we'll expose the files directly from the website.

And, finally, the app will generate the files dynamically on demand.

Maybe somewhere during that process I'll figure out how to hook a Unity game directly to a web service and we can skip the file stage.
Not likely, because the file is just going to be [JSON](https://www.json.org/) data which is exactly what the web service will return.

I suppose the real difference between a web service and just some JSON files will be some kind of puzzle-finder API.

That is all for now.
Thank you for your kind attention.
