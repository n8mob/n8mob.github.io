title: Getting Lost at the Mall

I don’t know how old I was. I was at the mall with my mother. I imagine she was trying something on in a store, but I don’t really remember. At some point I wandered off and got lost.

I think I even exited the store. A nice lady found me and sat me down on a bench. I imagine I was crying – but I don’t remember. She or I decided that we should pray to find my mommy.

She prayed to Jesus and looked up, which I thought was weird. Whenever we prayed we bowed our heads and prayed to Heavenly Father "in the name of Jesus Christ, amen." But – it worked well enough because my mom found us.

In my memory she was walking purposefully in jeans and a top of some kind. Maybe it was pink. I was sitting on a bench thing with the lady. The look on her face was a mixture of relief and concern.
