title: Apple Spray-Paint Invitation

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-confirms-mystery-jan-27-creative-event.ars">ArsTechnica posts</a> confirmation of an Apple event on Wednesday, 27 January, 2010.</p>

<p>Most speculate that this event will be the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/05/intel-germany-c/">long-awaited</a> announcement of the <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/history_apple_tablet_rumor">longer</a>-<a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2003/pulpit_20031127_000450.html">awaited</a> Apple tablet device. If that’s the case, I draw the following inferences from the invitation’s spray-paint motif – along with rumors about a radical new user-interface:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The device will have a color display. Reading that back to myself, it seems obvious – however, many expect the device to compete with e-readers such as Amazon’s Kindle.</li>
  
  <li>If the spray-paint motif is more than just a cool design element, the device’s new UI will be able to emulate a spray can. Specifically, I imagine moving a spray can in and out to change the line-width. That would mean that the input mechanism will incorporate some 3-D elements. I envision a fancy stylus… but who knows.</li>
  
</ol>

<p>P.S. I bought a few shares of Apple stock.</p>
