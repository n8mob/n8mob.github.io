# Version Four Point Oh: Now with ads!

## New Tutorials
In the new(ish) sub-menus, under **INTRO** and **TUTORIALS**, there are some new tutorials.
The tutorials are mostly about bits - alone and in groups. But you can still find the tutorials about **Decoding** and **Encoding** messages in there as well.

## Ads!
Now we will show ads between levels.
(Not after **EVERY PUZZLE**, but in between groups of puzzles.)
Kind of annoying, but, we gotta make those dollars *somehow!*

Menu Stuff
-------------
Added the word "MENU" to the menu screen.
Changed the menu icon to not be broken some times.

Thank you for your kind attention. -- n8
