title: Monitor Shopping
---

Last year I decided that I wanted a personal computer mostly for editing photos. (Mostly I’d been doing my editing and other personal work on my work computer.) I decided to get a small computer with a good graphics card – this would allow me to have a nice, portable machine and if I wanted to hook it up to a bigger monitor I could.

Well – I want to hook it up to a bigger monitor. So now I’m shopping for monitors. I’m spending my “Extended Benefits”; there are some other wishes on my list – so price does matter – but it’s not the most important factor. There are a couple of different strategies that I could take.

1.	Waltz into Best Buy and get whatever I want. They don’t sell anything larger than twenty-four inches and none of them will display more than 1,920 x 1,080 pixels – any of those would fit my budget.

2.	Get a smaller display (between twenty and twenty-four inches) with good image quality.

3.	Get a larger display (more than twenty-five inches) with low resolution

4.	Go whole hog and get a gorgeous twenty-seven inch display with high resolution.
