Maggie washed her hands, rinsed them, and then stepped on the pedal that started the dryer. After seventeen seconds the dryer stopped and she had to release the pedal and step on it to start it again. After about seven more seconds her hands were dry and the stupid thing kept blowing hot air as she walked out of the bathroom. Why did it have to stop after seventeen seconds. Why not twenty-five? Why not just stay on until she let off the pedal?

It was the same with her alarm clock. First thing this morning, her snooze button quieted her alarm for exactly nine minutes. Why not ten? Why not eight? Why not fifteen? Why not a little dial that let her choose how long to snooze? 

After that it was the bus buzzer. They could figure out how to tell her that she had missed her bus, but they couldn't figure out how to tell her that the bus was three stops away and she had better get moving or she _would_ miss it.

Then the mopping machine startled her by alarming when she dared to crossed its path. If its sensors could tell she was in the way, why not just stop the drive motors and give her four seconds to move out of the way. It's not like she had stopped in the middle of the walkway to have a conversation. She was just _walking!_
