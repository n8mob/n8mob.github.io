The last few days I’ve come home from work just exhausted, even though I’ve hardly accomplished anything. I’m spending much too much time surfing the web. And yet I’m working on my dream project. What’s the problem? I’ll tell you what the problem is: dealing with other people’s designs and code.

I’m not creating anything – I’m only figuring out what other people’s creations. I don’t mind building on top of something else – but building is what I want to do. I’m trying to think of an analogy. I don’t know.
