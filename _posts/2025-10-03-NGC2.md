I skimmed a [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/anduril-palantir-battlefield-communication-system-has-deep-flaws-army-memo-says-2025-10-03/) saying that a battlefield communications prototype has *deep flaws.*  
Painfully relatable: comms-system flaws (a subset of the painfully relatable topic of “system flaws”). The real question is whether they’re embarrassing, catastrophic, or just the kind you fix after a weekend of debugging. When I was working on airline reservation systems, it was always a relief to note that if I screwed up the system, planes wouldn’t crash; the airline would just lose millions of dollars and make the network news.

I have zero experience with battlefield communications, but I’ve worked as a ham-radio volunteer with the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run. We’re currently modernizing the runner-tracking system. The “legacy” system is built on AX-25 packet radio, but even that system relies more and more on Internet links — basically substituting telnet for the packet-radio interface. More than one aid station connected over Starlink at the 2025 race.

Scanning the article, the acronym **NGC2** stood out. It means “next-generation command and control.”  
Searching for that term led me to [peoc3n.army.mil](https://peoc3n.army.mil) (a real “.mil” URL? Bad-ass — pardon my French).

The briefs seem very buzzword-compliant to this Seasoned Software Engineer: simplify networks, adopt open architecture, modular systems, build from a data backbone. The Army even talks about iterative prototyping.  
At the same time, the Army is collapsing multiple legacy funding lines into this portfolio ([DefenseScoop](https://defensescoop.com/2025/03/24/army-next-gen-c2-contract-acquisition-what-look-like/)).  
And to prototype, they awarded **Team Anduril** an OTA for **$99.6 million over 11 months** ([Breaking Defense](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/army-awards-team-anduril-nearly-100m-to-lead-ngc2-prototype-for-4th-infantry-division/)).  
The Army’s total portfolio ask for NGC2 is around **$2.95 billion** — commonly rounded to ~$3 billion ([DefenseScoop](https://defensescoop.com/2025/07/02/army-next-gen-command-and-control-budget-2026-request-3-billion/)).

And here’s where the plot thickens:  
An internal Army memo (authored by CTO Gabriele Chiulli) calls the current prototype “very high risk,” citing security gaps: unrestricted data access, missing activity logs, unclear user boundaries, and code vulnerabilities in third-party modules.  
[Palantir pushed back](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-rebuts-claims-security-flaws-175038234.html), saying the memo snapshot is outdated and that vulnerabilities are being addressed.

So what am I trying to say? A few takeaways:

- **This is familiar territory.** The core engineering problems — degraded ops, bandwidth prioritization, chaotic integration — are ones I’ve sweated over on a smaller scale. That makes this story less about hype and more about scaling tough trade-offs.  
- **Prototyping is smart.** Spending ~$100 million to test real-world behavior *is* a risk, but the real risk is not that the system doesn’t work; it’s that they don’t learn anything from its failures.  
- **Open architecture is the only sane path.** If they actually deliver modular APIs, a shared data layer, vendor on-ramps, etc., then this might break the legacy-vendor trap. But that’s the $2.95 billion question.  
- **Buzzwords are cheap; execution is expensive.** “Agile,” “data-centric,” “interoperability” — sure, get the slide deck approved. Executing those buzzwords in “contested environments” (a favorite euphemism I just learned) is another story entirely: challenges include power limits, hardware failure, organizational inertia, and (cover your manager’s ears) key distribution.

Being in the Accenture universe for a few years gave me the flavor of gigantic projects and contracts. But government — let alone military — contracts are out of my league. I just skimmed the article (I couldn’t find the actual memo… Reuters cited it as “an internal Army memo”).  
Still, if I want to be a l33t 21st-century h4x0r, I’d better learn the new colors of Crayola books.
