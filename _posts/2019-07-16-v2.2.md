Hello, Everybody!

Thanks for all your bug reports and feedback!

Today we release version 2.2 for beta testing

# Here are the beta links
## [TestFlight for iPhone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/obsIYcRN)

## [Google Play Store Beta for Android](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.corporealabstract.magie).

Wishful thinking: Hopefully this will be the last beta version before we go live.

There has been some polish to the interface (graphics and sound), but the biggest changes in this version are in puzzle content.
So please let me know where you get confused or if a puzzle doesn't make it clear what you are to do.

Changes in v2.2
1. Graphics should be a little bit cleaner and more consistent
2. "Ta-Da!" Sound
3. Ad moves to the bottom of the screen
4. Puzzle win bits instead of level win bits
5. Menu should render faster, (but louder)
