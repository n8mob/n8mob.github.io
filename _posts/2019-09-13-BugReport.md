# Version three-point-five is alive!

[See release notes from the beta]({% link _posts/2019-09-12-v3.5-beta.md %}) to find out what changed and what is new.


## Mostly

The main menu now has sub-menus! Hooray for organization!

## Bug Report
Something has been bothering me: when you tap a level in the menu, sometimes the puzzle doesn't load!

I figured out that the problem is with the bits that show which puzzles have been completed in a level.
If you hit one of the bits when you scroll, no problem. But if you hit one of the bits when you are trying to go to the level, it will not open the puzzle..

Long story short: the bits were blocking the tap on the menu button. I'll have it fixed in v3.6, but I figured it out right after we launched v3.5 today - so I thought I'd share it with you, even though we haven't fixed it yet.

Thank you for your kind attention. -- n8
