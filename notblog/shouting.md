## Shouting from the House Tops

Jimmy sat on his roof wondering if he was ready. There was a hand-full of people gathered around his house; he figured that he owed them something just for showing up. He keyed up his PA and said, “Hi, there.” A few folks shouted “hi” back at him. But he was the one with the PA, so he just started reading his script.

“Modern forty-tooth gears are worlds smoother than even the best hundred-toother from sixty years ago. So it’s easy to see why manufacturers are trying to get away with the thirty- and even twenty-five-tooth gears in entry-level transmissions…”

By the time he had finished reading that first paragraph he was in his comfort-zone: transmissions. He could (and did) talk with people about transmission for hours at a time. His education was engineering, but he was mostly a technician these days. People would bring their transmissions to him and ask him to fix them, or troubleshoot them, or sometimes even customize them. He liked the work and it paid well.

## Shouting from _Your_ House Top

Anyone can shout from their house top. All you need is a house with a top and some way to climb up there. However, if you want more than your neighbors to hear what you have to say you’ll need some basic equipment.

The simplest form of amplification is the megaphone. The modern-day electronic version is often called a bull-horn.
