# Relevant Experience

## Port and Integrate Stand-Alone Application
### 2022
Nate was the technical lead for a mix of front-end and back-end developers. The project goal was to port an internal, employee-facing application into the main customer-facing app for ReliaQuest, an enterprise cybersecurity provider.

Nate and the team worked with ReliaQuest's Data Engineering team to set up jobs to transfer the data from the active internal app into a **PostgreSQL** database. The team developed a **Java** **Spring Boot** **microservice** to serve the data to the front end. The front-end developers on the team built components and pages within the existing customer-facing app to display the information from the internal application to internal and external users.

## Prepare Legacy Appointment app to Integrate with main Web Site
### 2013
Take Care Health Systems ran health clinics at employers and at some Walgreens store. Walgreens had acquired the company and was in the process of creating new applications for patients to book appointments at the clinics. The project had slipped and the appointment-booking feature would not be ready in time.

The existing Take-Care appointment app was sufficient to fill the gap while the new appointment app was finished. So Nate was tasked to strip all the Take Care branding provide a simple target to embed in the Walgreens web site.

All the developers who had worked on the existing app had left the company and were not available for consultation. So Nate used a class-diagram generating tool to quickly understand the structure of the code and find all the components that were involved with the features that would be used in the stop-gap solution.

## Senior Software Engineer, Ancestry, Inc. 
### 2015&ndash;2018

### Monolith BreakUp and conversion to Micro Services
### Commerce department at Ancestry
Nate worked on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, the team also worked on breaking the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to the **AWS** cloud.

All this while implementing new features and helping the team raise their standards for software excellence.
