# Expert Skills
**Software Design and Architecture**

Nate has an intuitive creativity that is hard to come by in engineers. Combining this creativity with an uncanny knack for abstraction and a natural aversion to inefficiency helps him see connections and boundaries to make truly simple designs.

[US Patent 8942991B2: Agent-side traveler application for mobile computing devices](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8942991B2/en)

This patent illustrates Nate's ability to reduce complexity. Here, the steps of finding a bus route, and selecting a destination are reduced to a single swipe of a credit card.

**Java 8**, **HTTP**, **REST**, **HATEOS**, **C#**, **.NET**

# Proficiencies
**JAX-RS**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **Maven**, **Eclipse**, **Visual Studio**, **NuGet**, **Microservices**, **Scrum**, **Lean Development**

# Overview
After more than ten years in the **.NET** ecosystem, Nate has spent the last three years traveling to **Javaland**. Before that he worked on all manner of **.NET web applications** from implementing a **SiteCore** commercial **CMS** to writing a **custom HTTP handlers** to draw a **PDF**.

# Current Project
## Monolithic Breakup and Switch to Java
### Commerce department at Ancestry
Nate is working on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, Nate is also helping to break the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to **Amazon Web Services**.

All this while implementing new features and helping the team raise their standards for software excellence.

# Mobile Projects
## REST endpoint to provide mobile app with content from Sitecore Content Management System
### 2014
While working to convert the main website from **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** *content management system (CMS)*, a new feature was being developed in the company's native mobile apps. Nate quickly exposed content from the CMS as **JSON** output so the mobile developers could deliver their feature on time.

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
### 2010-2012
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** *apps* in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## Mobile Game in the Windows Phone marketplace
### 2011
Nate and a friend developed and released a puzzle game to the **Windows Phone** marketplace. Nate found many exciting technical challenges including programming animations and subtle interactions in the **Windows Phone** flavor of **Silverlight**.

Releasing the **minimum viable product** taught Nate and his friend a lot about **project management** and **prioritization**. While they hoped for greater success for the game, the lessons learned were well worth the effort.

# Payment Projects
## Russian Low-Cost Airline - 2006
The Russian Post Office provides a payment service. A simple barcode contains information to identify the unpaid airline reservation. The customer takes the barcode to the post office and pays the amount due. Then the post office will settle with the airline on the back end.

Nate developed the ASP.NET HTTP handler that would get the current booking from session state and generate the PDF with the barcode for the customer to take to the post office.

## 3D Secure<br /> Various Airlines 2009&ndash;2012
The process goes like this: customer purchases something (in this case an airline reservation). At the end of the purchase flow, if the cardholder is enrolled in 3D Secure, instead of taking payment information directly, the merchant site sends purchase information to the 3D-secure card issuer. The customer is then given an HTTPS web form from the card issuer's domain where they can securely fill in the payment details.

The card issuer verifies the payment information and the amount due and then sends the customer back to the designated page on the merchant's site. The redirect GET or POST contains the original booking identifier and a payment confirmation code which the merchant can then record as proof of payment.
