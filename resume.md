# Current Project
## Chain Chat
### Nov 2018&ndash;Present

Nate is currently working on ***Chain Chat*** &mdash; A binary-encoding puzzle game. It is inspired by the *Castle Turing* chapter from Neal Stephenson's [*The Diamond Age: A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer*](https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Age-Illustrated-Primer-Spectra-ebook/dp/B000FBJCKI). 

# Expert Skills
Nate has expert skills in **Java 8**, **HTTP**, **REST**, **HATEOS**, **C#**, **.NET**. But his real passions are in the areas of:

**Mobile Strategy**, and<br />
**Software Design** and **Architecture**

Nate has an intuitive creativity that is hard to come by in engineers. Combining this creativity with an uncanny knack for abstraction and a natural aversion to inefficiency helps him see connections, find boundaries, and make truly simple designs.

[US Patent 8942991B2: Agent-side traveler application for mobile computing devices](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8942991B2/en)

This patent illustrates Nate's ability to reduce complexity. Here, the steps of finding a bus route, selecting a destination, booking a ticket, and collecting payment are reduced to a single swipe of a credit card.

# Proficiencies
While he wouldn't claim to be an expert, Nate is proficient in **JAX-RS**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **Maven**, **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Visual Studio**, **NuGet**, **Microservices**, **Scrum**, **Lean Development**

# Past Mobile Projects
## REST endpoint to provide mobile app with content from Sitecore Content Management System
### 2014
While working to convert the main website from **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** *content management system (CMS)*, a new feature was being developed in the company's native mobile apps. Nate quickly exposed content from the CMS as **JSON** output so the mobile developers could deliver their feature on time.

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
### 2010&ndash;2012
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** *apps* in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## Mobile Game in the Windows Phone marketplace
### 2011
Nate and a friend developed and released a puzzle game to the **Windows Phone** marketplace. Nate found many exciting technical challenges including programming animations and subtle interactions in the **Windows Phone** flavor of **Silverlight**.

Releasing the **minimum viable product** taught Nate and his friend a lot about **project management** and **prioritization**. While they hoped for greater success for the game, the lessons learned were well worth the effort.

## Senior Software Engineer, Ancestry, Inc.

### Monolith BreakUp and conversion to Micro Services
### Commerce department at Ancestry
Nate worked on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, the team also worked on breaking the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to **Amazon Web Services**.

All this while implementing new features and helping the team raise their standards for software excellence.
