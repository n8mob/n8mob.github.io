<h2 class='subtitle'>nate@nategrigg.com<br />+1 801 599 NATE</h2>

Nate has an intuitive creativity that is hard to come by in engineers.
Combine this creativity with an uncanny knack for abstraction and you get ingenious technical solutions. Mix in Nate's natural aversion to inefficiency and you end up with truly elegant designs.

# Expert Skills
Nate has expert skills in **Web Services** (**Django and Flask**, **Java**, **.NET**).

But his real passions are in the areas of:
**Mobile Strategy**, and  
**Software Design** and **Architecture**

# Proficient Skills
While he wouldn't claim to be an expert, Nate is proficient in **Python**, **JAX-RS**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **.NET Core**, **Maven**, **NuGet**, **PIP**, **Microservices**, **Scrum**, **Lean Development**, and **Oxford Commas**

# Current Project
## [MAGiE: MAGnetic Interactive Explorer](https://magiegame.com/magie/)
### Nov 2018&ndash;Present

Nate just released a mobile game, built using the [**Unity**](https://unity3d.com/unity) game engine with **C#** scripting. He has built a [small library](https://github.com/n8mob/alpha) for the underlying bit manipulation and used [**NuGet**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.corporealabstract.alpha.lib/) to manage that dependency in the **Unity** project. Working on his Mac, he has learned about [**dotnet core**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about) and he has been learning the **JetBrains Rider** IDE to make his life easier.

While managing beta tests and releases, Nate earned a new respect for continuous delivery and release management!

The game is called MAGiE, short for MAGnetic Interactive Explorer. The premise is that you have this device that reads binary data from a mag-stripe like on a credit card. The game then presents you with puzzles where you have to decode the bits to read a message, or encode bits to answer a puzzle.

It's lots of fun, you should try it!

# Past Mobile Projects

## REST endpoint to provide mobile app with content from Sitecore Content Management System
### 2014
While working to convert the main website from **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** *content management system (CMS)*, a new feature was being developed in the company's native mobile apps. Nate quickly exposed content from the CMS as **JSON** output so the mobile developers could deliver their feature on time.

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
### 2010&ndash;2012
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** *apps* in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## [US Patent 8942991B2: Agent-side traveler application for mobile computing devices](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8942991B2/en)
### Application Filed May 2011

This patent illustrates Nate's ability to reduce complexity. Here, the steps of finding a bus route, selecting a destination, booking a ticket, and collecting payment are reduced to a single swipe of a credit card.

## Mobile Game in the Windows Phone marketplace
### 2011
Nate and a friend developed and released a puzzle game to the **Windows Phone** marketplace. Nate found many exciting technical challenges including programming animations and subtle interactions in the **Windows Phone** flavor of **Silverlight**.

Releasing the **minimum viable product** taught Nate and his friend a lot about **project management** and **prioritization**. While they hoped for greater success for the game, the lessons learned were well worth the effort.

## Senior Software Engineer, Ancestry, Inc. 
### 2015&ndash;2018

### Monolith BreakUp and conversion to Micro Services
### Commerce department at Ancestry
Nate worked on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, the team also worked on breaking the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to the **AWS** cloud.

All this while implementing new features and helping the team raise their standards for software excellence.
