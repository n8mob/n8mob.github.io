# Expert Skills
**Software Design and Architecture**

Nate has an intuitive creativity that is hard to come by in engineers. Combining this creativity with an uncanny knack for abstraction and a natural aversion to inefficiency helps him see connections and boundaries to make truly simple designs.

**Java**, **HTTP**, **REST**, **HATEOS**, **C#**, **.NET**

# Proficiencies
**JAX-RS**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **Maven**, **Eclipse**, **Visual Studio**, **NuGet**, **Microservices**, **Scrum**, **Lean Development**

# Overview
Nate has spent the last three years transitioning from **C#** and **.NET** to **Java** technologies. Before that he worked on all maner of **.NE web applications** from **CMS** to **custom HTTP handlers**.

# Current Project
## Monolithic Breakup and Switch to Java
### Commerce department at a major online media company
Nate is working on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, Nate is also helping to break the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to **Amazon Web Services**.

All this while implementing new features and helping the team raise their standards for software excellence.
### Java, Spring, Maven, .NET, AWS


# Mobile Projects
## REST endpoint to provide mobile app with content from Sitecore Content Management System
While working to convert the main website from **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** *content management system (CMS)*, a new feature was being developed in the company's native mobile apps. Nate quickly exposed content from the CMS as **JSON** output so the mobile developers could deliver their feature on time.

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** apps in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## Mobile Game in the Windows Phone marketplace
Nate and a friend developed and released a puzzle game to the **Windows Phone** marketplace. Nate found many exciting technical challenges including programming animations and subtle interactions in the **Windows Phone** flavor of **Silverlight**.

Releasing the **minimum viable product** taught Nate and his friend a lot about **project management** and **prioritization**. While they hoped for greater success for the game, the lessons learned were well worth the effort.
