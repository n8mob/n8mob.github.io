# Expert Skills
**Software Design and Architecture**

**Java**, **HTTP**, **REST**, **HATEOS**, **C#**, **.NET**

# Proficiencies
**JAX-RS**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **Maven**, **Eclipse**, **Visual Studio**, **NuGet**

# Overview

Nate has spent the last three years transitioning from **C#** and **.NET** to **Java** technologies. Before that he worked on .NET web applications from CMS to custom HTTP handlers

# Current Project
## Monolithic Breakup and Switch to Java
### Commerce department at a major online media company
Nate is working on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, Nate is also helping to break the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to **Amazon Web Services**.
### Java, Spring, Maven, .NET, AWS

# Mobile Projects
## REST endpoint to provide mobile app with content from Sitecore Content Management System
While working to convert the main website from **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** *content management system (CMS)*, a new feature was being developed in the company's native mobile apps. Nate quickly exposed content from the CMS as **JSON** output so the mobile developers could deliver their feature on time.

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** apps in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## Mobile Game in the Windows Phone marketplace
Nate and a friend developed and released a puzzle game to the **Windows Phone** marketplace. Nate found many exciting technical challenges including programming animations and subtle interactions in the **Windows Phone** flavor of **Silverlight**.

Releasing the **minimum viable product** taught Nate and his friend a lot about **project management** and **prioritization**. While they hoped for greater success for the game, the lessons learned were well worth the effort.

# Other Recent Projects

## Sitecore Migration
As a Sr. Software Engineer at Intermountain Healthcare, Nate worked to migrate Intermountain's consumer-facing sites and content from Microsoft's **SharePoint 2010** to the **Sitecore** content management system (v6.6).

Nate's tasks on the project included (but were not limited to)

- Consume web services from other systems
- Integrate those services with **Sitecore**
- Build custom **Sitecore** controls
- Export data from **SharePoint**
- Import data to **Sitecore**

## work in progress... more to come.
