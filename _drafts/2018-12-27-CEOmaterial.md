One time I was working for a company called Navitaire. JetBlue was one of Navitaire's customers - they had offices in the same building.

Lufthansa had bought a large share in JetBlue and they were going to merge JetBlue's operations and reservations into the platform that Lufthansa was using. So, JetBlue's time as a customer of Navitaire was almost over. The Navitare CEO was leaning on my cubicle, talking to someone about a discussion with JetBlue: they weren't going to be off of Navitaire's system before their contract expired.

I imagined ingratiating myself to JetBlue, trying to keep them as a customer: "if we just work hard enough and please these guys, they'll decide to stay with us." But that's not what CEO did.

Because he knew it made sense for JetBlue to consolidate with Lufthansa. (Why run two reservations systems?) So, instead of trying to win them back, he simply took advantage of the situation. I paraphrase what he said there in the hallway: "...So I said, 'sounds like you have a business problem. I don't mind helping you out...'" and he rubbed his fingers and thumb together.

I was a little bit awestruck. "I guess that's why he's a CEO and I'm not", I thought to myself.

But now I am a CEO. Granted, we're just two guys in a garage, but I have to start thinking this way.
