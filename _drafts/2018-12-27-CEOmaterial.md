One time I was working for a company that made airline reservation software. An airline that you may have heard of was one of their customers - they had offices in the same building.

A major international airline had bought a large share in this customer, and they were going to merge their operations and reservations into the platform that the international airline was using. So, their time as a customer was almost over. The CEO was leaning on my cubicle, talking to somebody else about a discussion with this soon-to-be-ex customer: they weren't going to be off of the system before their contract expired.

I imagined ingratiating myself to this airline, trying to keep them as a customer: "if we just work hard enough and please these guys, they'll decide to stay with us." But that's not what CEO did.

He knew it made sense for the two airlines to consolidate their systems. (Why run two reservations systems?) So, instead of trying to win them back, he simply took advantage of the situation. I paraphrase: "...So I said, 'sounds like you have a business problem. I don't mind helping you out...'" and he rubbed his fingers and thumb together.

I was a little bit awestruck. "I guess that's why he's a CEO and I'm not", I thought to myself.

But now I am a CEO. Granted, we're just two guys in a garage, but I have to start thinking this way or we'll never... *get off the ground!!!*
