I'm going through boxes of junk, trying to "minimize". (You know, for hipsters!)

I found my sixteen year old cell phone and thought I should check for private information before dropping it off at [BestBuy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/04/03/records-show-deep-ties-between-fbi-and-best-buy-computer-technicians-looking-for-child-porn/).

Sixteen?? My phone's old enough to **drive!**

Anyway - here I will catalog some of the interesting names in my phone.
I'm not sure when I stopped using this phone. But I'm guessing some time in 2003 or 2004.
