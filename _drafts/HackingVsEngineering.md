title: Hacking VS Engineering

When we're unable (or unwilling) to describe the work that we're doing, we're hacking, not engineering.

I love hacking. I'm a hacker. I've been to [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org)... how many times have I been? I think my first one was in 2002 or 2003. 2002. It was DEF CON 0A (as the badge said).

## DEF CON BOTS

DEF CON BOTS at [DEF CON 14](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-post.html) was my senior project for my BSCS at the University of Utah. We destroyed the contest.

### Contest Rules
A grid of targets will be presented:
- Approximately 2 meters square
- Black background
- White circles with infrared LEDs
- Whoever shoots the most targets in 5 minutes wins.
- If multiple teams shoot down all targets, then fastest time wins

We worked with the assumption that shooting all the targets would be a given, so we optimized for speed.

# Add engineering story here

WSBPress was on the forums, scoping out the competition. He said, "we're like the big Russian guy in _Rocky IV_," the opposite of the underdog.

The key difference was that we were four senior engineering students, each working on the project ten to twenty hours per week for five months. Our competition was mostly individuals working in their basements in their spare time. (One competitor was a high-school kid and his dad.)

# Tie in to conversation about photography

If you can't describe the process, then you can't farm it out to your assistant.
