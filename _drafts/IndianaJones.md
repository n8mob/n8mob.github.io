The reason I'm making this post for a placeholder. I can't remember what age I was when I went to Disneyland with my folks and rode the Indiana Jones ride for the first time.

I was impressed by the line.
They gave everyone decoder ~rings~ business cards to decode the monoalphabetic substitution cipher (lame) on the walls.
They had a fake generator strung up to the lights around the fake archaeology dig. The generator would cough and sputter and all the lights would dim (rad).

Perhaps I should apply to the Imagineering department.

I started reading [this post](https://aux.avclub.com/the-met-gala-wasnt-shit-compared-to-the-1995-indiana-jo-1825870380) and remembered about going on that ride. Now I'm trying to remember when that must have been.
