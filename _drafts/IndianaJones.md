The reason I'm making this post is because I can't remember what age I was when I went to Disneyland with my folks and rode the Indiana Jones ride for the first time.

I was impressed by the line.
They gave everyone decoder ~rings~ business cards to decode the monoalphabetic substitution cipher (lame) on the walls.
They had a fake generator strung up to the lights around the fake archaeology dig. The generator would cough and sputter and all the lights would dim (rad).

Perhaps I should apply to the Imagineering department.
