title: Software Assembly Line
---

Lean manufacturing is based on an assembly line churning out products. Cars. Toyota cars.
Software (lean or otherwise) is not an assembly line.[citation-needed]
So why are we trying to use assembly-line techniques to fix our software processes?

Let's stick with cars, Henry Ford is famous for bringing assembly-line techniques to car manufacturing[1]. Reducing the price of automobiles to the point where they were affordable to the mass market.

Before that, car chassis were manufactured and then the bodies were hand-crafted by [coachbuilders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachbuilder).
