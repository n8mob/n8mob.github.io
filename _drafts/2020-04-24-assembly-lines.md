title: Software Assembly Line
---

Lean manufacturing is based on an assembly line churning out products. Cars. Toyota cars.
Software (lean or otherwise) is not an assembly line.[citation-needed]
So why are we trying to use assembly-line techniques to fix our software processes?

Let's stick with cars, Henry Ford is famous for bringing assembly-line techniques to car manufacturing[1]. Reducing the price of automobiles to the point where they were affordable to the mass market.

Before that, car chassis were manufactured and then the bodies were hand-crafted by [coachbuilders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachbuilder).

Long after the Ford made the assembly line famous, small manufacturers were still building low-volume cars by hand. But this practice is so expensive that only expensive niches could be filled. Mostly ultra-luxe, royal-carriage, Rolls-Royce limousine type cars and ultra high-end performance cars.

Some snobs would say that these manufacturing techniques were used because only hand-built cars could meet their exacting standards of performance and luxury. But the real truth is, so few people would end up buying those cars, that building a modern manufacturing program would eat up all the profits. (According to Wikipedia [2], a single die can cost $40,000.)

So, die-making is an up-front capital expenditure. A barrier to entry. It's where the phrase "re-tooling" comes from.

...

Long story short: we _are_ an assembly line, but we're not churning out whole products. We're churning out features, or at least pull requests.
