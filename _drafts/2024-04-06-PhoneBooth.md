I built a pay phone.

Well, not a pay phone, but a phone booth.

Well, not a phone booth, but a pay-phone enclosure. Kiosk. The thing they put around pay phones on the wall.

And it's not real. It doesn't work. It doesn't _do_ anything. It's more like a prop.




WHAT'S A PAYPHONE?

The above article includes a photo of the author, Steven K. Roberts, on the ground using a Tandy Model 100 portable computer in 1984.

“Does he have to be right there? Is he using the phone?” Asked Libby

“Yeah, he’s got the payphone jacked into his little computer there on the ground.”

“What’s a payphone?” asked Thomas.

I explained, “it’s just a phone sitting out somewhere. You put in some money, dial a number, then they pick up and you have a phone conversation. Right there at the phone.”

Charlie found an exceptional condition, “what if they don’t answer?”

“Then you hang up and the money comes out.”

Thomas found a exceptional condition, “if you still had the phone up to your ear, then the money would go into your ear!” He was grinning widely when he said that 😄
