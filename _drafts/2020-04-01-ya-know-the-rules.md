title: Ya Know the Rules - April Fools!
---

From off the sidewalk, I grabbed the mic and talk
Born nineteen sixty-five in the state of New York
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport
Lived on the streets about eight years straight
There I got my education and learned to debate
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm saying
Education doesn't come from simply obeying
The curriculum of the school criteria
In fact what I learned, I found inferior
I'm not a Muslim, but I do support them
My father in heaven taught me and taught them
I'm not a Christian, but I won't dis'em
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master
I don't eat beef, pork, or Diet Shasta

Reason for this is very simple indeed
When it comes to music, everybody's in need
You got wealthy artists spending money loosely
You ask about their culture, they talk about Gucci

Metaphysics: the science of life
And how to live free from strife
Walk with ease and no disease
Understand that I am the breeze
And the trees, oceans and seas
And the B and the D and the P's

Suckers try it, but I don't buy it
When I speak you seek and stay quiet
Shut up! What, what? You better stay cool
