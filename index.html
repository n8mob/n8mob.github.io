    <h1>The Index Page for My New Blog Thing</h1>
    <h2>
      Yet another unfinished bloggin project.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My plan? Update this thing once-a-week or more.
      My prediction? It will look like this for a week, then I'll make the last update for ten or twelve weeks...

    <h2>Now I Can Blog!</h2>
    <p>
      I've finally set it up so I can post static HTML files... Perhaps I made it harder than it is.
