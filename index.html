  <h1>The Index&nbsp;Page for {{ site.title }}</h1>
  <h2>Yet another unfinished blogging project.</h2>
  <p>
    My plan? Update this thing once-a-week or more.
    My prediction? It will look like this for a week, then I'll make the last update for ten or twelve weeks...
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, here it is, several months later, and about the only thing here is {% raw %} {{ page.title }} {% endraw %} (that's &ldquo;{{ page.title}}&rdquo; to you and me...)
  </p>
  <h1>Some Posts</h1>

  {% for post in site.posts %}
      <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
      <a href="{{ post.url }}" class="index-link"><h3>More...</h3></a>
  {% endfor %}

  <h2>2016-02-13</h2>

    I suppose I should start dating my entries. This is a log after all. (A <strong><em>web</strong> blog</em>.)
    <h2>Now I Can Blog!</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    I've finally set it up so I can post static HTML files... Perhaps I made it harder than it is.
    what else?
