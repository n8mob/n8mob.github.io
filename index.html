    <p>Hi! I'm Nate. This is one of those blogs that get updated quite sporatically and with no particular theme.</p>
    <p>But Jeff Atwood told me in a YouTube video to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/">Embrace thhe Suck and Do It In Public.</a> And then Austin Kleon told me in a book to <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work.</a> Oh, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat</a> taught me that "perfection erases humanity." And then Tom Sachs did that <a href="https://www.tomsachs.org/exhibition/space-program-europa">Space Program thing</a>, and I was reminded of an insight that I had a long time ago.</p>
    <p>I was turning in a magazine assigment in elementary or middle school. My professional graphic-designer dad had helped me desktop-publish a decent National Geographic parody about mushrooms. I was proud of the work we had done. And I was about to scoff (silently, internally) at the work of a fellow student, when I realized that the reason mine looked so good was because of all the help I had from my dad. The content was all mine, and the National Geographic cover was my idea. But the well-done presentation of which I was proud, was all him. This other student had done all the work himself.</p>
    <p>I realized that if I had tried to do the magazine myself, even if I had gotten the National Geographic cover looking good, I would have run out of steam before I finished the magazine. I imagined a 3rd grader's crayon-rendered magazine. If it had a beginning, middle, and end, it would be superior to my "excellent" beginning.</p>
    <p>And so, I make an imperfect website.</p>
