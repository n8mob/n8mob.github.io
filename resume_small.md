# Project Highlights

## Monolith Break-Up and conversion to Micro Services
### Ancestry 2016&ndash;2018
Nate worked on replacing a suite of monolithic **.NET** services with Java **mini**&zwnj;services. Aiming to build **micro**&zwnj;services, the team ended up building services that were a little larger than intended. So, while breaking up the **monolith**, the team also worked on breaking the **mini**&zwnj;services into **micro**&zwnj;services. The team also spent the last year "lifting and shifting" all of these services (**micro**, **mini**, and **monolithic**) to **Amazon Web Services**.

All this while implementing new features, raising standards for software excellence, and improving delivery times for new features.

### Java 8, JAX-RS, REST, Micro-Services, Spring Dependency Injection, Maven

## Mobile Web Application for booking flights
### 2010&ndash;2012
Nate built a prototype **Mobile Web Application** for making airline reservations using *Navitaire's* **New Skies** reservation system. One of Navitaire's major European customers needed a mobile booking flow *yesterday*. Nate proposed polishing the prototype web app and the customer agreed.

During the polishing project, the CEO of the Airline insisted that the mobile booking flow be accessible from **Android** and **iOS** *apps* in the app stores. While development continued on the mobile web app, developers working for the airline built native apps with web controls to wrap the mobile web app.

## Patent for "One-Click Booking" for A Bus Ride
### 2010&ndash;2011
[US Patent 8942991B2: Agent-side traveler application for mobile computing devices](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8942991B2/en)
While making a proof-of-concept for a customer pitch, Nate and his colleagues made a web app that would allow a bus driver to reserve and sell a reservation on the bus with a single swipe of a credit card. Accenture decided to patent it.
