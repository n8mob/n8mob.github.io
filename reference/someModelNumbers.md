## A Story

When I was very young I wanted to push all the buttons on my dad's Stereo. At one point he had gotten it down to move it or clean behind it or something. I had the bright idea, "if it's un-plugged then I won't hurt anything by pushing all the buttons."

I suggested it to my dad and he acquiesced.

I liked the clicks of the push-buttons and the kerchunk of the tape transport controls (you know, play, pause, stop). I particularly liked how the stop button would cause the rewind and fast-forward buttons to pop back up again.

But the best, by far, were the little push-on, push-off button switches. That tiny, little snip of a click inside there... What else is there to say? Anyway, I was trolling around on eBay looking at vintage computers and things and I realized: I bet one of those cassette decks would go for less than fifty bucks these days.

So I spent a few minutes poking around [VintageCassette.com](http://www.vintagecassette.com/) trying to determine even what brand that deck was. I think I've narrowed it down to the [Sharp RT-20](http://www.vintagecassette.com/sharp/rt-20). ([Some Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=sharp+stereo+cassette+deck+rt-20&safe=active&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiihpj0r9bSAhVjsVQKHT-lBu8QsAQIIw&biw=1680&bih=949#imgrc=_). The push-on, push-off button switches are the tall, skinny ones in the center between the MIC inputs and the transport controls, below the <samp>COMPUTER CONTROLLED MULTI-DISPLAY</samp>

So, here I have collected some model numbers - in case I ever need them to settle an argument.

Before I got the PRO-51 I had a less-expensive model.

I'm looking at the 1994 catalog at [radioshackcatalogs.com](http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/1994/h087.html). I'm certain that I had one of those scanners in the summer of 1994. I got my ham radio license in January of 1995, and I had the scanner _months_ before my
