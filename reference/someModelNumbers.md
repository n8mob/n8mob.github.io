# A Story

When I was very young I wanted to push all the buttons on my dad's Stereo. At one point he had gotten it down to move it or clean behind it or something. I had the bright idea, "if it's un-plugged then I won't hurt anything by pushing all the buttons."

I suggested it to my dad and he acquiesced.

I liked the clicks of the push-buttons and the kerchunk of the tape transport controls (you know, play, pause, stop). I particularly liked how the stop button would cause the rewind and fast-forward buttons to pop back up again.

But the best, by far, were the little push-on, push-off button switches. That tiny, little snip of a click inside there... What else is there to say? Anyway, I was trolling around on eBay looking at vintage computers and things and I realized: I bet one of those cassette decks would go for less than fifty bucks these days.

So I spent a few minutes poking around [VintageCassette.com](http://www.vintagecassette.com/) trying to determine even what brand that deck was. I think I've narrowed it down to the [Sharp RT-20](http://www.vintagecassette.com/sharp/rt-20). ([Some Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=sharp+stereo+cassette+deck+rt-20&safe=active&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiihpj0r9bSAhVjsVQKHT-lBu8QsAQIIw&biw=1680&bih=949#imgrc=_). The push-on, push-off button switches are the tall, skinny ones in the center between the MIC inputs and the transport controls, below the <samp>COMPUTER CONTROLLED MULTI-DISPLAY</samp>

So, here I have collected some model numbers - in case I ever need them to settle an argument.

# A List

## Sharp RT-20
Cassette Deck of my father

## Folding Cassette Recorder
My father also had a cassette recorder that folded in half. I think it was too old to be a "boombox".

One side had a latch and the other a hinge. Undo the latch, and the whole back of the recorder could swing around to face the front. I believe the rear folding speaker connected by a removable 1/8" (3.5mm) jack. And I remember the hinges had easily-removable pins so the two could be separated by a foot or two.

Trying to remember the make so I can try to find the model.

## Fisher-Price #826
[Brown Fisher Price ~~Cassette~~ Tape Recorder](http://www.thisoldtoy.com/l_fp_set/toy-pages/800-899/826-fisherprictaperecorder.html)

## GoldStar TSR-603
I believe this was a Christmas gift around 1983 or 1984.

One summer (probably '85 or '86) I found that when the garage door was open, it was as good as a shelf. So I climbed up on the roof of my parents maroon Chevy Nova and put the tape player up there. Later, the garage door closed and the thing fell off the garage door.

I don't remember if it fell straight to the concrete or if the Nova broke its fall. Either way, the damage was done. Some scratches in the silver paint on the corners and the door to the cassette compartment broke off entirely.

I do remember that the thing would still play tapes if you just clicked them into the open compartment. So I kept using it until my birthday in 1987 (I'm sure of the year because there is video evidence). On that birthday, my parents got me a sweet YORX with removable speakers!

## [YORX BP1000](http://wikiboombox.com/tiki-index.php?page=Yorx+BP-1000)
So cool! TCP: *Tripple* Cassette Player!! Two in front and one in the top. **And the top one came out like a Walkman!!!!!!!!!** I don't know how many [Dr. Demento Shows](http://drdemento.com/) got recorded on that thing. But it was a lot! The show [started at 10pm on Sunday night](https://youtu.be/REpfGo4-jGA?t=6). So I'd listen and pause for commercials until the first side of the tape was full. Then I'd flip the tape over. (Auto-reverse? we're not there yet, Sport.) After the tape got flipped I'd pause a couple more commercials and then allow myself to fall asleep. I didn't have auto-reverse, but I did have auto-stop; it was 1987, after all.

Most (but not all) of the time it would catch the [end of the show](https://youtu.be/TM9xldatBUo?t=80).

Before too long I acquired a C120 two-hour cassette that could catch the whole show even if I didn't pause for commercials. Unfortunately, I only had one C120, so I couldn't archive the shows. I just recorded each show over the last one and then listened to it in pieces all week long. Usually I'd finish on Saturdays while I mowed the lawn.

## Panasonic RX-SR29
After the portable player out of the top of the BP1000 stopped working, I replaced it with the [Panasonic RX-SR29](http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/walkman/panasonic/panasonic-walkman-models/). I put that giant thing in my pocket and carried it around in Middle School. I ran some earbuds up through my shirt. (Originally the ones from my original GameBoy, but later some Sony ones.)

## Radio Shack TRC-226
Hand-Held CB Radio Transceiver

## Radio Shack PRO-51
200-Channel Direct Entry Programmable Scanner

## Radio Shack PRO-25
Maybe
Before I got the PRO-51 I had a less-expensive model.
It had the two semi-circle buttons for <samp>SCAN</samp> and <samp>MANUAL</samp>.

I'm looking at the 1994 catalog at [radioshackcatalogs.com](http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/1994/h087.html). I'm certain that I had one of those scanners in the summer of 1994. I got my ham radio license in January of 1995, and I had the scanner _months_ before my
