    <h1 class="title">Lunch Duty</h1>
    <p>In fifth grade students helped serve lunch in the cafeteria. I was excited to get out of class – even if it meant dishing up 600 sloppy joes.</p>
    <p>After a week of helping the lunch ladies it was back to class as usual. A few weeks later the opportunity again presented itself. However, this time my teacher would not allow it because I had not made up the work I missed the last time.</p>
    <p>“Wait.” I thought to myself, “I wasn’t in class but you still want me to do the work that the kids in class did?”</p>
    <p>To me, school and class were just what I was supposed to do. The classwork was completely abstracted from any meaning.</p>
